"""
This program checks whether a specific version of Checkbox is available for a
series of snaps and if the correspondent packages are available in a given PPA

There are two matrixes of all combinations stored in a yaml file and the
program periodically checks whether all combinations are available and
waits until either all of them are available or the timeout is reached.
The first argument is the version of the snaps and packages to check for.

The characteristics for the snaps that can be specified are:
  - (required and 1) channel that all of the snaps must be in
  - (required and 1 or more) names of the snaps
  - (required and 1 or more) architectures for all of the snaps

The characteristics for the packages that can be specified are:
  - (required and 1) channel of the package (same as the PPA name)
  - (required and 1) name of the source
  - (required and 1) name of the package (.deb file)
  - (required and 1 or more) versions of ubuntu
  - (required and 1 or more) architectures


For instance, to check if the "checkbox22" related snaps are available, all
having a version of "3.3.0-dev10", for the architectures:
  - amd64
  - arm64

This effectively means we will check the availability of the following snaps:
  - checkbox22_3.3.0-dev10_amd64.snap
  - checkbox22_3.3.0-dev10_arm64.snap

The snap specs specified in the yaml look like this:
```
required-snaps:
  - name: checkbox22
    channels: [ latest/edge ]
    architectures: [ amd64, arm64 ]
```


In the same way we can check whether the packages are available in the PPA.
For "checkbox-ng" the specs specified in the yaml look like this:
```
required-packages:
  - channel: edge
    source: checkbox-ng
    package: checkbox-ng
    versions: [ "18.04", "20.04", "22.04", "24.04" ]
    architectures: [ amd64, arm64 ]
```

So, considering `checkbox-canary.yaml` contains both parts, the invocation
to check if both snaps and packages are available would be:
```
    python3 checkbox_version_published.py 3.3.0-dev10 \
    checkbox-canary.yaml --timeout 300
```
