# hwcert-jenkins-tools

Utility scripts and tools authored by the Certification Team to enhance and automate CI/CD pipelines.

## Downloadable installer

Certification tasks that need to make use of the tools in this repo can use the downloadable installer:

```bash
curl -Ls -o install_tools.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/hwcert-jenkins-tools/main/install_tools.sh
source install_tools.sh tools --branch LM-1580-sru-refactor
```

The installer clones this repo in a readable, consistent manner.
It can also clone from branches, useful in cases where new tools are being developed and tested.

## An overview of available tools

### Elementary actions over ssh

#### Run commands on the device

The `_run` script executes the specified command on the device over SSH.

Examples:
```
_run mkdir /var/tmp/pts-cache
_run sudo reboot
_run sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:firmware-testing-team/ppa-fwts-stable
_run sudo snap refresh
_run sudo snap install --no-wait $RUNTIME_NAME --channel=$RUNTIME_CHANNEL
_run [ -f /var/snap/docker/current/config/daemon.json ]
_run "snap model --assertion" | sed -n 's/^store:\s\(.*\)$/\1/p'
```

The `_run` script, as well as all other scripts that rely on executing commands
over SSH, rely on the following:
- The `DEVICE_IP` environment variable must be set, in order to specify the IP of the device.
- If the device requires a non-standard username (i.e. different than `ubuntu`) it should specified through the `DEVICE_USER` environment variable.
- If a password is required in order to SSH into the device, it should be specified through the `DEVICE_PWD` environment variable.

#### Transfer files to and from the device

The `_put` and `_get` scripts can transfer files to and from the device over SSH.

Examples:
```
_get /snap/$CHECKBOX_FRONTEND/current/bin/launcher checkbox-launcher
_put certification.gschema.override :
_put "${DEVICE_SCRIPTLETS[@]/#/$SCRIPTLETS_PATH/}" :"$TOOLS_PATH_DEVICE"
```

### Barriers

There are instances where the execution of the testing script needs to be
blocked, waiting for a specific state to be reached before proceeding.

#### Wait for a device to be reachable

The `wait_for_ssh` script exits when the device is up-and-running,
ready to execute commands over SSH.

Internally, the script runs `systemctl is-running` on the device and
it depends on the returned value to determine if the system is ready.
Normally, only the `running` state results in the `wait_for_ssh` script
exiting. If the system is `starting` or `stopping` then `wait_for_ssh`
will keep retrying, so it often follows `_run sudo reboot` in order
to ensure that no further commands are executed until the device is
ready.

The `--allow-degraded` flag can be used in cases where it is acceptable
that the device is in a `degraded` state, due to some services that have
failed to start.

Example:
```
_run sudo reboot
wait_for_ssh --allow-degraded
```

There are default values for the number of retries and the delay between
them but if these aren't appropriate they can be set explicitly through
the `--times` and `--delay` command-line arguments. This applies to all
`wait_` scripts.

#### Wait for all deb installation actions to complete

The `wait_for_packages_complete` script exits when all package operations
(apt, dpkg) are complete. This is useful in cases when background updates
or auto-updates might be running. It is also handy when certain lock files
might remain locked for slightly longer, even though no package operations
are ongoing.

Example:
```
_run wait_for_packages_complete
```

Note that this particular script is executed directly _on the device_
(it is copied over to the device when the installer runs).

#### Wait for all snap changes to complete

The `wait_for_snap_changes` script exits when all snap operations on the
device are complete.

It is suggested that snap operations on the device (like installing or
refreshing snaps) are performed with the `--no-wait` option, followed by
a call to `wait_for_snap_changes`. This ensures stability and reliability
when a snap operation might lead to a reboot or might require a manual
reboot (which the script checks for and performs, when necessary).

Examples:
```
_run sudo snap refresh --no-wait
wait_for_snap_changes
```

### Installing packages

It is suggested that Debian packages are installed on the device using
the `install_packages` script. The script itself can accept these flags:
- `--no-update`: do not perform an update before installation
- `--dist-upgrade`: perform an upgrade instead of installing packages
All other arguments after a `--` are propagated to `apt-get install` and
no `--` is required if there are no script arguments.

Examples:
```
_run install_packages linux-generic
_run install_packages --install-recommends $PACKAGES
_run install_packages --no-update -- checkbox-provider-phoronix libssl1.1
```

Note that this particular script is executed directly _on the device_
(it is copied over to the device when the installer runs).

### Installing Checkbox

Installing Checkbox is typically a non-trivial multi-step process and it
is strongly suggested that the `install_checkbox_debs` and `install_checkbox_snaps`
scripts are used for this purpose.

Examples:
```
install_checkbox_debs stable
install_checkbox_debs beta --providers checkbox-provider-certification-server
install_checkbox_snaps checkbox=latest/beta
install_checkbox_snaps checkbox-shiner=latest/edge --additional checkbox-ce-oem=latest/stable
```

On non-provision machines, it is also hightly recommended that the
`clean_machine` script is used as early as possible:

```
_run clean_machine --im-sure
```

Note that this particular script is executed directly _on the device_
(it is copied over to the device when the installer runs).

## Additional tools

### A "stacker" for Checkbox configuration files

Certification tasks need to assemble several Checkbox configuration files (e.g. a common "head", a test plan, a manifest, environment variables) into a single file, also adding a description to it.

This repo contains `stacker`, a purpose-built Python tool that offers this functionality.

```bash
stacker --output checkbox.conf launcher.conf manifest.conf --description "A description"
```
