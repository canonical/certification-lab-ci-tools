# Install Checkbox on the DUT and the agent
#
# Description:
#
# Installs Checkbox snap (runtime + frontend) on the DUT. Also installs
# Checkbox on the agent from source matching the version on the DUT
# Finally the installation on the DUT is verified to check that the machine is
# ready to run tests.
# The `risk` parameter can be either "stable", "beta", "edge" and is used for
#   both runtime and frontend
# The `runtime_name` can be any of the runtime snaps (eg. checkbox16,
#   checkbox24 etc.)
# The `frontend_name` can be any of the frontend snaps (eg. checkbox,
#   checkbox-tillamook).
# The `frontend_track` parameter can be any valid track name (eg. 22.04, uc16).
#   It is also used to appropriately install the snap (decide if a snap is
#   classic or strict)
