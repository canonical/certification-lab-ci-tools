"""
This program checks whether snaps with specified characteristics are available in the snap store.

The matrix of all combinations is created and the program peridically checks
whether all combinations are available and waits until either all of them are
available or the timeout is reached.
The characteristics that can be specified are:
  - (required and one) version that all the snaps must have
  - (required and one) channel that all of the snaps must be in
  - (required and 1 or more) names of the snaps
  - (required and 1 or more) architectures that all of the snaps must be available for

For instance we want to check whether there are following checkbox-related snaps:
 - checkbox22
 - checkbox16
 - checkbox
all having a version of "2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef"
for the architectures:
    - amd64
    - arm64

which in reality means we want to check whether there are following snaps:
    - checkbox22_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_amd64.snap
    - checkbox22_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_arm64.snap
    - checkbox16_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_amd64.snap
    - checkbox16_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_arm64.snap
    - checkbox_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_amd64.snap
    - checkbox_2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef_arm64.snap

The specs are specified with a yaml that looks like this:
required-snaps:
    - name: checkbox22
        channels:
            - edge
        architectures:
            - amd64
            - arm64
So the invocation of this program would be:
    python3 snap_version_published.py 2.9.2-dev5-123abcdef checkbox-snaps-for-canary.yaml
