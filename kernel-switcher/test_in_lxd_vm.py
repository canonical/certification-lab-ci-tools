This is a test script for the kernel switcher.
It uses LXD to create a VM in which the test script runs this sequence:
- install a kernel that's older than the default
- reboot
- check that the old kernel is _still not_ running
- use the kernel switch tool to switch to the old kernel
- reboot
- check that the older kernel is running
